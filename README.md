# Ittyon

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/ittyon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/ittyon)

Ittyon is a simple library designed to manage state in games,
particularly distributed state in a client/server architecture. It
supports both Clojure and ClojureScript, so is particularly suitable
for web-based games.

Ittyon draws inspiration from the [entity component][1] model, but
provides a greater separation between code and data. Its data model
has a lot in common with [Datomic][2].

## Installation

Add the following to your project dependencies:

```clojure
[ittyon "0.0.11"]
```

## Overview

### State

State in Ittyon is defined as a set of **facts**. A fact is a vector
of four elements:

```clojure
[entity aspect value time]
```

These are often abbreviated to `[e a v t]`.

An **entity** is a unique identifier. Ittyon uses UUIDs for this
purpose.

An **aspect** is a namespaced keyword, usually one derived from
`:ittyon.core/aspect`.

A **value** is any immutable value.

A **time** is a positive integer that ascends over time. Ittyon uses
[Unix time][3] for this purpose.

### Aspects

Clojure allows hierarchical relationships to be defined between
keywords via `derive`, and Ittyon takes advantage of this system to
allow aspects to share common behavior.

Ittyon comes with two base aspects you can derive from:

* `ittyon.core/aspect`
* `ittyon.core/singular`

All of your aspects should derive from `:ittyon.core/aspect`. This
adds basic validation, such as ensuring the entities are UUIDs, and
the time is a positive integer.

It also provides a way of atomically removing an entity via the
`:ittyon.core/live?` aspect. This can only be true, and must be set on
an entity before any other aspects can be set. When this aspect is
removed, the entity is removed.

By default, aspects can have multiple values per entity. The
`:ittyon.core/singular` aspect forces an aspect to have only one value
per entity. When a new value is asserted, the old value is revoked.

For example, consider a `::timer` aspect that contains a single
numerical value. It could be defined:

```clojure
(require '[ittyon.core :as i])

(derive ::timer ::i/aspect)
(derive ::timer ::i/singular)
```

Because an aspect may be derived from many parents, Ittyon provides
its own `derive` function that can take a variable list of parent
keywords to derive from.

```clojure
(i/derive ::timer ::i/aspect ::i/singular)
```


### Transitions

Facts can be added or removed to a state through the use of
**transitions**. Transitions contain the same elements as facts,
prefixed with an **op**.

```clojure
[op entity aspect value time]
```

The op is a keyword of either `:assert`, which adds a new fact, or
`:revoke`, which removes an existing fact.

Transitions are applied to a state with the `ittyon.core/commit`
function. When a transaction is committed, three steps are followed:

1. Validation
2. Indexing
3. Reactions


### Validation

Validation checks whether the transaction can be added to a supplied
state. This is achieved via the `ittyon.core/-valid?` [intention][4],
which takes the current state and a transaction as arguments, and
dispatches off the op and aspect.

For example, consider the `::timer` aspect introduced earlier. Let's
say that it should have a non-negative integer as a value. Using the
Intentions library, we define a conduct that extends `-valid?`.

```clojure
(require '[intentions.core :refer [defconduct]])

(defconduct i/-valid? [:assert ::timer] [state [o e a v t]]
  (and (integer? v) (>= v 0)))
```

If validation fails, `commit` returns the state without changes.

Once a transition passes validation,
